 [![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/google-font-downloader.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-font-downloader) [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/google-font-downloader.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-font-downloader)







> Download Google fonts by providing the url






#### Usage


You can use this tool to download Google Fonts for offline use, just by providing the Google APIs url.


:bulb: **Note**: It's not clear yet if Google Fonts are EU GDPR compliant (see [this issue](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1495)). This may be a good reason to download the Google Fonts you use on your server.

#### How it works


You need to provide the url to the Google APIs endpoint (e.g. `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,400i,700,700i`) and you will get the following files/directories in the current working directory:


 - A file named `google-fonts-<timestamp>.css`—this will contain the CSS snippets that you need to copy in your app. You may need to update the paths to the font files.
 - A directory structure looking like this: `fonts/<font-name>/<version>/<font-file>`
